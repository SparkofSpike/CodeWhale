/**
 * Owned registrations: the host half of `registry/register` for one kind.
 *
 * Every shim that contributes something to the core (tools, commands) follows
 * the same life cycle: propose it with `registry/register`, keep the handle
 * the core admitted, undo exactly that handle when the plugin's effect is
 * disposed, and report a refusal so activation fails with the core's reason.
 * The Rust side is the authority (`OwnerRegistry`); this only keeps the
 * host's own index by handle so a later `tool/call` or `command/run` can find
 * the definition.
