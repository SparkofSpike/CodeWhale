//! `core/call`: an extension tool, while it handles a `tool/call`, asking the
//! core to run one of the core's tools for it.
//!
//! The call goes through the same gate as a call the model makes. The turn
//! loop serves it (`Engine::gate_nested_call`, source `Extension`): planning
//! (allow and deny lists, preparation, hooks, ask-rules, Auto-Review, repo
//! law, the authority envelope), then the approval card when one is needed,
//! then execution by the same machinery code mode uses
//! ([`CodemodeInvoker`]). Nothing the host sends decides any of it: not an
//! approval, not the card's text (Rust composes it, naming the extension and
//! the tool it is inside), not an argv or a URL, not the ticket's contents.
//!
//! **When it exists.** An invocation ticket is minted only for an extension
//! tool call that runs under a nested-call gate the turn loop is serving *for
//! that tool* (`NestedCallGate::extension`, set by the turn loop when the model
//! called the tool directly). A sub-agent's call, a tool run from inside
//! `execute_tools` (code mode hands nested specs no gate), a command, a timer,
//! activation code and every test without a turn have none, so their
//! `core/call`s are refused ("out of turn"). The ticket lives exactly as long
//! as the invocation: it is revoked when the `tool/call` ends (answered,
//! failed, timed out or dropped), when its owner is revoked and when its host
//! exits, and each of those withdraws the invocation's pending core calls and
//! any approval card one is waiting on.
//!
//! **What is refused outright** ([`refusal`], checked before planning on the
//! name the host sent and again by the turn loop on the name planning resolved
//! it to and the final, hook-rewritten input): everything code mode refuses
//! before its gate (`execute_tools`, interpreters, `agent`, `workflow`, `rlm`,
//! `request_user_input`, interactive shells, sandbox escalation, Computer Use
//! consent and scripts, MCP sign-in); any extension tool (no recursion); tool
//! search and tool-result retrieval; the memory writer and the tools that
//! change what the session may do or schedule work beyond it; and every MCP
//! tool, Computer Use included (not in v1: CURRENT_DECISIONS 26, the founder's
//! recorded default).
//!
//! **What prompts** ([`origin_approval`]): an extension's call needs approval
//! unless the tool is in the small read-only, workspace-local table
//! [`EXT_AUTO_ELIGIBLE`] and planning found nothing that asks; its approval
//! keys are scoped to the extension plugin build
//! (`approval_cache::extension_origin_approval_keys`), so a grant the user gave
//! the model never covers an extension's call and the reverse. Shell and
//! network calls force a prompt: a session grant is not consulted, and
//! Full Access still opens their card. Auto-Review and Never refuse them
//! (`resolve_approval_request_disposition`); explicit denials always win.
//!
//! **Caps.** Per invocation: 50 `core/call`s in all (the ticket's uses), 4 at
//! once (code mode's own cap), and one approval card at a time (the turn
//! loop serves one request at a time). Per host: the channel's 256 in-flight
//! host requests. A burst of invalid tickets ends the host (`ticket`).
//!
//! **Time.** The `tool/call` deadline is measured on the invocation's pausable
//! clock, which stops while a `core/call` waits on the gate, so a person
//! taking a minute on a card does not time the tool out. An approval is never
//! decided for the person: when the host cancels, the owner is revoked, the
//! host exits or the invocation ends, the wait is withdrawn and recorded
//! cancelled.
//!
//! Known limits:
//! * The refusal list names tools; a tool added later that changes the mode,
//!   the posture or the permissions has to be added to [`REFUSED_NAMES`]
//!   (a test fails when a name in it stops being a tool the core registers).
//! * A withdrawn call retires its card through the typed `ApprovalWithdrawn`
//!   event on terminal and runtime clients. A later answer has no live waiter.
//! * Results come back as text (and structured JSON when the tool's content
//!   was JSON); images and other rich blocks are dropped, as in code mode.
//! * One extension tool call at a time holds the turn's tool lock, so a
//!   tool's `core/call`s run beside it, not through the lock.
