//! One extension-host process: launch plan, spawn, handshake, channel, exit.
//!
//! When the process exits, every in-flight call fails with a typed error.
//! The existing Rust manager owns heartbeat, crash budget, generation changes,
//! and receipt-checked replay; this channel never replays a tool call.
//!
//! **Host-originated requests** run as tasks, not inline in the reader. Each
//! request the host sends is admitted into [`InboundRequests`] (at most
//! [`protocol::MAX_INFLIGHT`] at a time, no id twice, both violations end the
//! host) and handed to [`HostEvents::host_request`] as its own task. It is
//! cancelled by the host's `$/cancel` (whatever the handler later produces is
//! dropped), by its owner's revocation (the host is answered `Cancelled`) and
//! by the host's exit (nobody is answered); a handler that ignores its token is
//! abandoned [`CANCEL_GRACE`] after the cancel. A method reserved for the other
//! tier is neither accepted from the host nor sent to it
//! (`protocol::MethodSpec::tiers`), and `host/hello` must report the tier the
//! core launched and the built-in module digests it pins
//! ([`check_hello_identity`]).
//!
//! **Tiers** ([`HostTier`]). The host is two processes, one per trust tier,
//! started from the same bundle with `--tier=plugin|builtin` as the last
//! argument. Each has its own data directory ([`tier_data_dir`]) and its own
//! sandbox plan; the plugin tier's also denies reads of the builtin tier's
//! data directory ([`host_denied_read_paths`]). Only the plugin tier starts
//! in production today.
//!
//! **OS sandbox** ([`HostSandbox`]: the one value `/plugin`, doctor and the
//! start diagnostic report). The host runs under Codewhale's command sandbox
//! with a workspace-write policy rooted at its tier's data directory (the
//! plugin tier's is `$CODEWHALE_HOME/extension-host/data`): no direct network,
//! writes only there and in the temp dirs, and **no reads** of the Codewhale
//! homes (everything but the bundle, its data dir and plugin code), the Codex
//! and DSH credential homes, and the credential-store default deny-list
//! (`sandbox::read_guard`). Other user-readable files stay readable —
//! including `.env` files, whose filename rule has no Seatbelt subpath or
//! bubblewrap mount form — so this is defense-in-depth, not a containment
//! boundary.
//! * macOS: Seatbelt. Mach services are not restricted.
//! * Linux: bubblewrap (`/usr/bin/bwrap`, the shell's builder), used without
//!   the shell's `prefer_bwrap` opt-in. Every launch first runs the finished
//!   wrapper around `<runtime> --version` ([`probe_bwrap`]). When bwrap is
//!   missing or cannot start — e.g. unprivileged user namespaces blocked by
//!   Ubuntu 24.04's `kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns` — the host
//!   refuses Native launch and reports the concrete error. The pinned Builtin
//!   exception is diagnosed and ticket-bound. bwrap can mask only what exists, so each
//!   Codewhale home is masked whole and its readable entries are bound again
//!   (`sandbox::bwrap_exception_args`): an entry created after launch is
//!   denied, as on macOS.
//! * Windows: Native uses a freshly created LPAC AppContainer with no network
//!   capabilities. Rust checks its actual token, attaches/caps the existing Job
//!   before resuming, and requires a real data-read/write + outside-read/write
//!   + loopback-network allow/deny probe. Only Core-selected runtime/bundle and
//!     reviewed staged roots are granted reads. The Job is lifetime/memory only.
//!     Builtin retains the separately diagnosed Rust-ticket-bound exception.
//!
//! Known limits under bubblewrap: a default-deny-list credential store
//! created after launch stays readable (Seatbelt denies it by name); a
//! Codewhale home, or a readable entry such as `plugins/`, that does not exist
//! at launch is not masked, or not visible, until the host restarts; bwrap
//! anywhere but `/usr/bin/bwrap` is not used; the probe costs one extra
//! runtime start per launch. The reported pid is bwrap's. The host runs in
//! bwrap's PID namespace, where its parent is bwrap's init and never
//! changes, so the host's own parent watchdog (`extension-host/src/main.ts`)
//! cannot fire; `--die-with-parent` is what ends it with the core. That is
//! a parent-death signal tied to the thread that spawned bwrap, a Tokio
//! worker that lives as long as the runtime. Plugin child processes end with
//! the namespace when bwrap's init loses the host.
//!
//! **Runtime.** Node (the default) or Bun (opt-in: `runtime = "bun"`, or
//! `"auto"`, which prefers a supported Bun), chosen once per manager
//! (`[extension_host] runtime`). Each gets its own flags ([`runtime_args`])
//! and environment ([`runtime_env`]); Bun silently ignores Node's heap and
//! `__proto__` flags. The host itself takes in-process native code away from
//! plugins (`extension-host/src/runtime.ts`: `bun:ffi`, `Bun.FFI`, SQLite
//! extension loading, Worker threads, ShadowRealm, `process.dlopen`) and
//! refuses to start if a lock does not hold. That lockdown covers the entry
//! points found so far (Bun 1.4, Node 22 and 26), not every one a runtime
//! may add.
//!
//! **Memory cap** ([`MemoryEnforcement`]). What was measured where: the
//! macOS mechanism on macOS 26.1 arm64 (2026-09-30, Bun 1.4.0 and Node);
//! the Linux thresholds in [`HOST_MEMORY_CAP`] in a Linux container
//! (2026-09-29). Hosted CI runs the Rust memory-cap test on Linux, macOS and
//! Windows with Node only; the Rust host tests have not run a Bun host on
//! Linux or Windows (CI's JS host suites run under Bun 1.4.0 on Linux).
//! * Linux: `RLIMIT_DATA`, set in the child before exec (clamped to an
//!   inherited hard limit that is already lower); an allocation past the cap
//!   fails. Plugin child processes inherit it.
//! * Windows: the Job Object's per-process limit; an allocation past the cap
//!   fails. It applies to each process in the job, plugin children included.
//! * macOS: `setrlimit(RLIMIT_AS/RLIMIT_DATA)` below the current mapping size
//!   fails with `EINVAL`, and `memorystatus_control` needs privilege. A fatal
//!   jetsam limit set as a `posix_spawn` attribute works unprivileged, but a
//!   later `exec` clears it, so it cannot be set on `sandbox-exec`. The Bun
//!   host therefore re-executes itself in place with the limit before any
//!   plugin loads, and reports it in `host/hello`; past the cap the kernel
//!   SIGKILLs it. Plugin child processes are not covered. A Bun host that
//!   cannot apply the requested limit is refused before initialization. Node
//!   has no FFI to do the same, so a Node host is checked at each heartbeat
//!   instead: enforced only as often as
//!   the heartbeat runs. Node also keeps `--max-old-space-size=256`.
