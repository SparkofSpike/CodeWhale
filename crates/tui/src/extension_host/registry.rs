//! Owned registrations: the Rust side is the authority (design §3).
//!
//! Every registration belongs to exactly one `(plugin_id, generation)` owner.
//! Revocation is synchronous and never waits for the host: removing an owner
//! removes its tools from every later turn's registry at once, and
//! `HostToolSpec` re-checks liveness before each call. Handles are never
//! reused, so undoing one registration can never touch a newer one.
//!
//! One registry serves both trust tiers ([`super::tier`]): an owner records
//! which host process it lives in, `begin_owner` refuses an id the tier cannot
//! hold (`host:<module>` is tier 0's alone), and a host exit removes only its
//! own tier's owners and registrations.
