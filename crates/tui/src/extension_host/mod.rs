//! Experimental TypeScript extension host — phase 1 (`[features] extension_host`).
//!
//! Codewhale's Rust core stays closed and authoritative: one turn loop, one
//! event authority, one store, one prompt authority, one approval gate. The
//! extension host (`crates/tui/extension-host`, a Bun or Node process running
//! the embedded bundle) is the only extensible surface, and in phase 1 it can do
//! exactly one thing: contribute tools, which become ordinary registry
//! `ToolSpec`s ([`tool::HostToolSpec`]) behind the existing gate.
//!
//! Lifecycle: a reviewed, enabled plugin with a `native` entry (activation
//! policy v4, selected by the flag) makes [`ExtensionHostManager::reconcile_in_background`]
//! spawn the host in the background — never on the first-prompt path — and
//! activate one owner per plugin. Tools join the per-turn registry at the next
//! rebuild, deferred. Disabling, revoking or updating the plugin revokes its
//! registrations synchronously before the host is asked to tear down.
//!
//! `core/call` ([`core_call`], tickets in [`ticket`]): an extension tool that
//! the model called directly may ask the core to run a core tool for it,
//! through the same gate as the model's own calls. The host decides nothing:
//! planning, approval and the card's text are Rust's, MCP and anything that
//! changes the session's authority are refused, and shell and network calls
//! force a prompt.
//!
//! Engines: the manager and its one host are process-wide, but each engine
//! holds its own [`HostAttachment`] carrying the plugin snapshot of its
//! workspace. Reconcile activates the union of what every attached snapshot
//! desires and revokes only owners no attachment desires. Each snapshot is
//! re-verified against persisted plugin state on every reconcile, so a
//! disable or revoke made through any registry revokes the plugin for every
//! engine. An engine installs only the tools of owners its own snapshot
//! desires, so a workspace never sees another workspace's project plugins.
//! Dropping an attachment detaches without revoking; the next reconcile
//! revokes whatever no remaining attachment desires. Engines without a
//! plugin snapshot of their own (isolated chats, the empty fallback) never
//! attach.
//!
//! Commands: a plugin may also contribute slash commands ([`command`]). They
//! are owned registrations like tools, loaded into the user command registry
//! at the lowest precedence, and run by `command/run` only when the user
//! invokes them.
//!
//! Plugin context: a plugin's `apply(ctx, config)` receives the settings from
//! `[plugins."<name>".config]` ([`plugin_config`]), and its tools and commands
//! are told, per call, the workspace the call comes from and the plugin's own
//! data directory. A plugin with several `native` entries activates them in
//! order under one owner.
//!
//! Known limitations (by design — see the design doc §8 and its "As built"
//! sections):
//! * Tools, slash commands, programmable pre-execute admission hooks, additive
//!   prompt sections and owner-local storage. Skills and MCP are not host services yet.
//!   The one thing the host may ask the core to do is a `core/call` from a tool
//!   under the turn's gate; commands, timers and activation code ask for
//!   nothing.
//! * Heartbeat and bounded automatic restart preserve the shared crash budget
//!   across engine creation and replay. Dead-host calls fail with a typed
//!   error and are never replayed. Three crashes in five minutes require an
//!   explicit plugin change/reload to retry. Two dirty teardowns within ten
//!   minutes retire the process once non-heartbeat calls are idle, without
//!   resetting or consuming the unexpected-crash budget.
//! * Every awaited core→host request is bounded by its method's deadline
//!   (`protocol::CoreRequest::deadline`) and then cancelled with `$/cancel`
//!   (`supervisor::HostProcess::call`). Cancellation is a request: a plugin
//!   that ignores its abort signal keeps running in the host until the host
//!   is torn down, though the core has already failed the call.
//! * One host per engine process and trust tier ([`tier`]): the plugin tier
//!   hosts reviewed third-party plugins, the builtin tier (tier 0) is for
//!   Codewhale's own host code and starts only for a row of
//!   [`tier::BUILTIN_MODULES`]. The MCP SDK backend starts its pinned module
//!   only when explicitly selected; plugin attachment does not start it.
//!   Under its OS sandbox
//!   (Seatbelt on macOS; bubblewrap on Linux when a launch-time probe shows it
//!   works) the host has no direct network, and cannot read the Codewhale
//!   home (except the bundle, its data dir and plugin code), the Codex and
//!   DSH credential homes, or the default credential stores
//!   (`supervisor::plan_launch`, whose module docs list what bubblewrap does
//!   not cover). Other files the user can read — including project `.env`
//!   files — stay readable, and Mach services are not restricted. On Windows,
//!   and on Linux where bwrap is missing or cannot start, Native launch is
//!   refused. The pinned Builtin exception is explicitly diagnosed and still
//!   ticket-bound. The flag remains Experimental.
//! * The runtime (`[extension_host] runtime`) defaults to Node. Bun is an
//!   opt-in (`bun`, or `auto`, which prefers a Bun >= 1.4.0 and uses Node
//!   when none is found) and is qualified on macOS only. The runtime is
//!   pinned once a host on it completes the handshake; restarts reuse it
//!   without probing it again, and the handshake refuses a host reporting a
//!   different runtime or version. Under `auto`, a Bun that fails to launch or
//!   handshake before anything is pinned is reported once and Node is used
//!   for the rest of the session; an explicit `bun`/`node` never falls back.
//!   The 1 GiB memory cap is applied through `RLIMIT_DATA` on Linux, the Job
//!   Object on Windows and, for a Bun host on macOS, a jetsam limit the host
//!   applies to itself; a macOS Node host is checked at each heartbeat
//!   instead. The Rust host tests have not run a Bun host on Linux or
//!   Windows (`supervisor` module docs say what was measured where).
//! * In-process native code is taken away from plugins by the host
//!   (`extension-host/src/runtime.ts`), for the entry points found so far; a
//!   native-code entry point a newer runtime adds is not covered until it is
//!   added there. A process a plugin starts is outside that policy and runs
//!   under the same verified OS sandbox required for Native admission.
//! * The owner token is a bug/staleness guard, not a boundary between
//!   plugins that share the process: one plugin can alter another's
//!   behaviour, which the approval card discloses.
//! * Extension tool names that any name-keyed approval table special-cases
//!   are refused (`registry::core_special_case`), so an extension tool never
//!   shares an approval key, summary or category with a built-in.
//! * The host's process tree (Unix process group / Windows Job Object,
//!   shared with hooks via `crate::process_tree`) is killed as a whole. On
//!   Windows the host is assigned to its job just after spawn, not created
//!   suspended as hooks are. On Unix a plugin child that calls `setsid` leaves
//!   the group and is not killed with it. When the core goes away, the host
//!   kills its own group at stdin EOF, and a watchdog thread does the same
//!   when its parent process changes, even if a plugin blocks the event loop.
//! * A running engine's snapshot is replaced only by its own workspace
//!   switch or by [`plugins_changed`] for the same workspace. A plugin newly
//!   enabled through another workspace's registry reaches an engine at its
//!   next snapshot, not at once; disables and revokes always reach it at the
//!   next reconcile, through the persisted-state check.
//! * The host re-hashes each `native` entry file before importing it; other
//!   files in the staged snapshot are covered by Rust's per-call receipt
//!   check, not re-hashed by the host.
