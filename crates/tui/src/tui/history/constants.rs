//! Shared constants for history transcript rendering.
//!
//! ## Live tool-card budgets
//!
//! The general command/output caps were measured against 53 real saved
//! sessions from `~/.codewhale/sessions` — 5,470 tool results, 4,001 of them
//! `Bash` (the "run" cards) and 3,777 `Bash` commands. Successful output uses
//! a smaller preview to reduce routine transcript noise; the details pager
//! retains the complete result.
//!
//! Observed `Bash` result length, in source lines:
//! `p25=3  p50=9  p75=25  p90=60  p95=113  max=1161`.
//!
//! Observed `Bash` command length: `p50=251 chars`, `p90=1404` — i.e. the
//! median command is multi-line once wrapped, not a one-liner.
//!
//! General command/output caps sit at the knee of their coverage curves: the
//! point past which more rows buy very little more content. Going further
//! chases a long tail that a single card should never try to hold — that is
//! what the details pager is for.

/// Six is the knee: +25 points over the old cap of 3, where 8 adds only 4
/// more and 10 only 2. At 3 the *median* command was clipped, which is the
