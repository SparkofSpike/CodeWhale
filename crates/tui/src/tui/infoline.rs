//! The shell's metrics line — one row of session numbers, painted under the
//! posture bar at the bottom of the screen.
//!
//! It used to be a top bar. The founder's call (SHELL-DESIGN-20260901 §2.0):
//! *"Putting the info at the bottom is a better idea, because then you scroll
//! up and it feels intentional. Move the top/side bar to the bottom."* Then
//! (2026-09-02): *less always-on information* — the repository and branch
//! moved to the launch header and the git bottom view, and the DeepSeek
//! harness session metrics came back on screen in their place.
//!
//! The row, left to right, separated by three spaces:
//!
//! ```text
//! deepseek-v4   ctx 22%   $0.14   ttft 400ms   38 tok/s   ↓ 1.2K      Ctrl+/ help
//! ```
//!
//! The model is the one route fact the user checks before a turn, and it
//! stays clickable to the picker; the context reading stays clickable to the
//! inspector. Both are the floor and never shed. Everything else is a
//! metric: the session cost (the same number `/cost`, the roster and the
//! price widget print), time to first token, output rate and output tokens —
//! measured latency/rate averages persist between receipts; the output count
//! updates during streaming. Missing measurements remain absent.
//!
//! The context reading is painted here and only here — the posture bar above
//! used to print the same percentage a second time from the same snapshot —
//! and at every fullness, not only from 50% up (#5950).
//!
//! Shed order as width drops: cache, output count and billing tier, the help
//! hint, then rate and TTFT, then cost and balance
//! ([`InfoSegmentId::shed_priority`]). The model and `ctx NN%` never shed; below that floor the row clips at its
//! right edge.
//!
//! Which segments exist at all is the user's call: `/statusline` and
//! `tui.status_items` compose the row, and [`crate::tui::ui::frame::info_segments`]
//! builds only the ones that are on. Shedding decides what survives the
//! width that is left. `tui.metrics_line` sizes the row (#5950): `hidden`
//! gives the line back to the transcript, and `compact` starts the shed
//! pass with secondary counts and the help hint already gone; TTFT and rate
//! remain when selected and space allows
//! ([`InfoLine::compact`]).
//!
//! Interaction: segment geometry is recorded for parity tests, but only the
//! model/route segment and the context reading advertise an action in the
//! live shell. Status-only facts do not brighten on hover or pretend to be
//! controls.
//!
//! Color: semantic ink only ([`ChromeInk`]); no hex, per the status-bar color
//! grammar. ASCII-safe mode substitutes every glyph through
//! the shared kit. Engine facts and action dispatch remain with the callers.
