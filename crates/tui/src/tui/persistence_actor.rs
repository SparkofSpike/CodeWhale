//! Dedicated persistence actor for session save / checkpoint I/O.
//!
//! ## Motivation
//!
//! Before this module, `persist_checkpoint` and `persist_session_snapshot` ran
//! synchronously on the tokio worker thread that drives the TUI event loop.
//! Each call serialised all API messages to JSON, wrote a temp file, and
//! renamed it atomically — blocking keyboard input for the duration.
//! `save_session` additionally called `cleanup_old_sessions`, which listed all
//! session files, parsed metadata from every one, sorted, and deleted the
//! oldest — scaling O(session-bytes + file-count) with every turn.
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! - **One dedicated tokio task** owns disk I/O. The UI only sends requests;
//!   keystrokes never wait for writes.
//! - **Latest-wins coalescing per session**: when multiple `SaveCheckpoint`,
//!   `SessionSnapshot`, or offline-queue requests pile up before the actor's
//!   next write cycle, only the most recent one per session is written.
//!   Checkpoints and clears are keyed by session id, so concurrent sessions
//!   never coalesce into (or clear) each other's slot.
//! - **Durability reporting**: `FlushAndReport` returns accumulated results;
//!   cycles without a listener log failures instead of discarding them.
//! - **Bounded command channel with sender-side coalescing** (#6212):
//!   `try_send` absorbs each request into a shared latest-wins state at send
//!   time and wakes the actor through a small bounded channel, so a paused
//!   consumer retains one snapshot per session instead of one per send.
//!   Queued snapshots retain only the canonical journal; legacy `messages`
//!   are derived at the disk boundary instead of doubling every paused
//!   request.
