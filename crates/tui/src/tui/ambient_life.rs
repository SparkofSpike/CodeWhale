//! Ambient ocean life for the underwater transcript field.
//!
//! One clear owner for the fish school, jellyfish, bubbles, and the rare
//! whale cameo — nothing else lives in the water (2026-07-23 product
//! decision: seaweed and bio-dust are gone). Motion stays inside the
//! existing delta/interpolation path: this module never requests frames on
//! its own.
//!
//! Native silhouettes use the shared 2×4 braille cell: fish move in half
//! columns with a one-dot bob; jellyfish rise in quarter rows. A bounded pose
//! table owns no clock or simulation. ASCII-safe terminals retain the original
//! silhouettes through the same habitat, population and collision path.
//!
//! Motion language (shared with the rest of the shell): every mark can lerp
//! between the water and its ink at a time-varying brightness. Fish carry a
//! travelling sin² wave, jellyfish a slow band-bounded pulse that opens and
//! closes the dome while the tentacles trail it by ~0.6 s, bubbles an
//! occasional raised-cosine glint. Phases are wall-clock keyed and entity
//! periods deliberately never match, so nothing strobes in sync.
//!
//! The jellyfish is a *visitor*, not scenery: one at most, present for roughly
//! a fifth of a ~5-minute cycle and dimmer than everything around it. See the
//! `JELLY_VISIT_*` constants for the rarity knobs and why they are set where
//! they are.
//!
//! Fish swim on a wrap-around path: they exit one edge and re-enter the
//! other still facing their travel direction, so facing always equals
//! velocity by construction. Direction may only change while the school is
//! fully off-screen.
//!
//! The aquarium has a habitat and it defers to whatever is composed above it.
//! Collision is one rule — [`is_open_water`]: a mark may only land in a
//! horizontal span that carries no text and has none within
//! [`TEXT_CLEARANCE_ROWS`] of it, measured off the rendered lines rather than
//! guessed from fractions of the field. Everything else follows from it. A
//! short status line therefore leaves honest water beside it instead of
//! claiming the whole row. The school rides a band off the
//! floor ([`SCHOOL_FLOOR_GAP`]); bubbles rise a few rows from the floor and
//! dissolve ([`BUBBLE_MAX_RISE_ROWS`]); the jellyfish only surfaces where
//! [`deep_water_rows`] says the water is deep enough to hold it *and* the
//! school; and the surface caustics stop at the first row of the composition.
//! Light above, life below, words in between — and as a transcript fills the
//! field the water closes row by row until nothing moves behind the text the
//! reader is actually reading.
//!
//! Two clocks feed this module and neither is a token counter. Positions ride
//! `App::sample_ambient_clock_ms`, which advances by real elapsed time clamped
//! to `App::AMBIENT_MAX_STEP_MS` per draw, so drift speed is identical at 16 ms
//! and 33 ms frames and a stalled-then-resumed frame cannot jump a creature.
//! Sideways *placement*, by contrast, is a function of the transcript text
//! under the silhouette — which does change with token throughput — so it is
//! bounded by [`JELLY_MAX_TEXT_DODGE_COLS`].
//!
//! Under reduced motion there is no ambient life at all: `ocean::life_presence`
//! returns 0 and rendering exits before building marks or initializing pet
//! tapes. Reduced motion spends no simulation work on invisible creatures.
//!
//! `render_ambient_life` returns per-frame budget counters
//! ([`AmbientFrameStats`]): marks built always splits exactly into painted +
//! text-skipped + clipped. Counting is a handful of `u32` increments — no
//! allocation, no frame requests.
