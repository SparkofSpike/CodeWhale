        "Read a UTF-8 file from the workspace. Use this instead of `cat`, `head`, `tail`, or `sed -n '..p'` in `Bash` — it's faster, sandbox-aware, and skips the approval prompt. Plain text is returned as-is and records the file snapshot required before `edit` will make a narrow in-place edit. Text reads report the whole file's `content_hash=\"sha256:…\"`; pass that value back as `expected_hash` on a later `write`, `edit`, or `patch` to have the write refused if the file changed in between. Codewhale config files and file-backed credential stores cannot be read with this tool; use `codewhale config list` or `codewhale auth status` for safe inspection. PDFs are text-extracted when the optional `pdftotext` executable (Poppler) is installed. Image screenshots are OCR-extracted when local OCR is available. Cannot read other non-PDF binaries.\n\nFor large files, use `start_line` and `max_lines` to read in chunks. By default, returns up to 500 lines or 16KB, whichever comes first. If `truncated=\"true\"` and `next_start_line` is present, continue reading from there; a byte-limited window instead shows head + tail with a `[CONTENT TRUNCATED]` marker and its note says how to narrow the range. For PDFs, use `pages` instead — `start_line`/`max_lines` only apply to text files."
