//! `execute_tools` — code mode: run a model-provided JavaScript program that
//! composes tool calls through `tools.call(name, args)`.
//!
//! The program handles loops, branching, filtering, and data movement;
//! intermediate results stay in the VM and only the bounded return value plus
//! a host-owned receipt reach the model. The engine-side precedent is the
//! synthetic interpreter dispatch (`js_execution` / `code_execution`): this
//! tool is engine-injected, never registered, and dispatched in
//! `core::engine::tool_execution`.
//!
//! Authority stays entirely in Rust, and there is one gate. In a main-session
//! turn the engine hands the program a [`NestedCallGate`]; every nested call —
//! native, plugin, or MCP — is sent back to the turn loop and planned by the
//! same `plan_tool_calls` a direct call goes through (deny/allow lists,
//! preparation, hooks, ask-rules, Auto-Review, repo law, the worker authority
//! envelope, the K1 Computer Use refusal), with the source tagged as code mode
//! so a nested call never activates a deferred schema. A nested call that
//! needs approval suspends the program: the engine raises the normal
//! approval request (`request_tool_approval`, same receipt log, same card) and
//! the program resumes on allow; on deny only that nested call fails, as an
//! exception the program can catch. Approving the program itself therefore
//! grants nothing, and `execute_tools` is prepared as auto-approved.
//!
//! Without a gate (sub-agents, direct unit calls) the program keeps the
//! Phase-1 profile: read-only, auto-approved native calls only, no MCP.
//!
//! Receipts (#6509): the host records every nested call when it starts, so a
//! program that hits its deadline still reports what finished, what was
//! refused, and what was in flight. Oversized nested results keep the
//! `{content, metadata, truncated}` keys, and the cut is never silent:
//! `truncated` names the original size and the spillover file holding the
//! full output, and `content` becomes the leading text of the raw output
//! (a JSON result cannot stay parsed once cut), so a script checks
//! `truncated` before reading fields. A failed call's text is bounded and
//! spilled the same way.
//!
//! KV-cache effect: `[features] code_mode` (on by default) makes
//! `execute_tools` eager from the first request of a session; with the flag
//! off it is deferred like the interpreter tools. The flag is session config,
//! so the prefix is stable within a session either way. The definition text
//! is static. Program text, nested results, and the describe-only nested
//! `tool_search` (which returns schemas without activating them) live in
//! append-only turn history, never in the prefix.
//!
//! Known limitations:
//! - Nested calls do not take per-tool locks against sibling top-level calls;
//!   the program runs under its own exclusive lock instead. Inside the
//!   program, calls the gate marks non-parallel run one at a time.
//! - No nested `agent`, `workflow`, `rlm`, `request_user_input`, interpreter,
//!   interactive shell, sandbox escalation, Computer Use consent/script, MCP
//!   sign-in, or recursive `execute_tools`. Those stay direct calls.
//! - Rich content blocks (images) from nested results are dropped; text and
//!   JSON payloads pass through bounded.
//! - Hidden from Plan mode and refused under a worker authority envelope,
//!   like the other execution surfaces.
