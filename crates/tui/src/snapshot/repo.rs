//! Side-git repository wrapper for workspace snapshots.
//!
//! `SnapshotRepo` shells out to the system `git` binary (we deliberately
//! avoid `git2` to dodge its LGPL surface). The two paths that matter:
//!
//! - `git_dir`  → `<snapshot state dir>/<project_hash>/<worktree_hash>/.git`
//! - `work_tree` → the user's actual workspace
//!
//! Every git invocation passes both `--git-dir` AND `--work-tree`. That is
//! the single biggest safety mechanism: it guarantees we never accidentally
//! mutate the user's own `.git` directory. If git can't find the side
//! repo, the command fails fast instead of falling back to "current
//! directory".
