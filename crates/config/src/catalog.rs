//! Models.dev-backed provider catalog snapshots and a secret-free live cache
//! (#3385, feeding EPIC #2608 and #3383).
//!
//! This module is **network-free** by construction. Callers supply parsed
//! [`crate::models_dev::ModelsDevCatalog`] JSON (bundled snapshot or live
//! refresh) and live [`ProviderCatalogDelta`]s; the HTTP `/models` fetch layer
//! lives above this module. Nothing here performs I/O or reads credentials.
//!
//! Layering (lowest precedence first):
//!
//! ```text
//! bundled Models.dev snapshot         (legacy seed, not competing truth)
//!   < live Models.dev                 (public catalog, external enrichment)
//!   < Codewhale corrections           (bundled field patches, see [`corrections`])
//!   < signed cloud facts              (curated correction, off by default)
//!   < live provider `/v1/models`      (credential-scoped workspace list)
//!   < config.toml / user overrides
//! ```
//!
//! The two live layers are not the same kind of claim. A provider roster is a
//! fact about an endpoint the caller authenticated to; models.dev is a public
//! third-party catalog that is merely fresher than the bundled copy of itself.
//! Only the first outranks a signed correction — see
//! [`CatalogSource::ModelsDevLive`].
//!
//! After #4187, live Models.dev rows are preferred over the bundled seed. The
//! bundled asset remains so offline startup and failed refreshes still resolve
//! defaults.
//!
//! Invariants preserved from #2608 / #3497:
//! - A catalog row is **not** an executable route. Rows still compile through
//!   `RouteResolver` into a `ReadyRouteCandidate` before execution.
//! - `wire_model_id` is kept separate from `canonical_model`; a provider row may
//!   not expose a canonical `base_model` join, and a prefix never proves
//!   canonical ownership.
//! - Unknown / custom / local rows are supported with explicit provenance and a
//!   `None` canonical model.
//!
//! The on-disk cache format intentionally uses plain `String` identity fields
//! rather than the internal route newtypes, so the persisted shape is decoupled
//! from internal types and trivially auditable for "no secrets" (see
//! [`ProviderCatalogCache`] tests).
