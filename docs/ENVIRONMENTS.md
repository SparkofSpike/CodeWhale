# Environment-specific caveats

Standard build/test/run commands live in `AGENTS.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
This file records only the non-obvious quirks of particular environments, so
they do not cost context on machines that will never hit them.

## Cursor Cloud VMs

- **System build dep:** the build needs `libdbus-1-dev` (pulled in by
  `crates/secrets` for the OS keyring). It is installed by the startup update
  script; if a `cargo build` fails with a `dbus`/`pkg-config` error, that dep is
  missing.
- **`rustup default` must be set:** some tests and runtime paths spawn shells in
  temp dirs *outside* this checkout (e.g. `run_verifiers_background_*`, sub-agent
  worktrees). Those spawned shells only see the repo's `rust-toolchain.toml`
  override while inside `/workspace`, so without a global default they fail with
  "rustup could not choose a version of rustc to run". The update script runs
  `rustup default stable` to fix this.
- **Known env-specific test failures at `/workspace` (not code bugs):** because
  the checkout sits directly under `/`, two `codewhale-tui` subagent tests fail
  here — `git_repo_root_reports_attempted_paths_when_no_repo_found` (cannot
  create a temp dir in the unwritable parent `/`) and
  `create_isolated_worktree_reports_friendly_error_when_no_repo_found` (walking
  up to `/` discovers `/workspace` itself as a repo). Both pass when the repo is
  checked out under a normal, writable parent.

## Running the agent without provider API keys

Point Codewhale at any local OpenAI-compatible endpoint via the keyless
`vllm`/`ollama`/`sglang` providers:

```sh
CODEWHALE_PROVIDER=vllm VLLM_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1 VLLM_MODEL=<id> \
  codewhale exec --auto "..."
```

`codewhale exec` (add `--auto` for tool use) is the non-interactive path to
exercise the full agent loop.

## Keeping the host awake during a turn

While an interactive TUI turn is in flight, Codewhale holds the platform's
idle-sleep assertion, so an unattended machine does not idle into sleep
mid-turn and lose the work:

- macOS: `caffeinate -i`
- Linux: `systemd-inhibit --what=idle --why="Codewhale turn in flight" --mode=block cat`,
  where `cat` reads a pipe Codewhale holds for the turn

The assertion is released the moment the turn ends — on Linux by closing that
pipe, so `cat` exits and `systemd-inhibit` follows without leaving a process
behind — and it covers *idle* sleep only: an explicit `sleep` / `pmset sleepnow`, a closed lid, or a low battery
still suspends the machine. Headless hosts — `exec`, app-server, CI — never
hold it, so a shared runner's power policy is untouched. Windows is not
implemented: `SetThreadExecutionState` is thread-affine and needs a holder that
pins the thread, so the gap is deliberate rather than silent.

If a turn is suspended anyway, the engine notices on wake — wall-clock elapsed
diverging from monotonic elapsed by more than the suspend threshold — reports
`System sleep detected; connection lost — retrying request`, and re-issues the
request instead of failing the turn (#2990).

## Windows PowerShell execution policy

The shell tool runs PowerShell with `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`. That sets only
the policy of the child process it launches: nothing is persisted, no
administrator rights are needed, and your own PowerShell windows keep their
policy. Without it, a machine whose local policy is `Restricted` (the Windows
client default) or `AllSigned` refuses the temporary `.ps1` script Codewhale
writes for multiline commands (#6745).

A policy set by Group Policy (the `MachinePolicy` or `UserPolicy` rows of
`Get-ExecutionPolicy -List`) outranks the process scope. On such a machine,
multiline commands are still refused and PowerShell's refusal is returned as
the command's error; Codewhale does not work around an administrator-enforced
policy. Single-line commands run through `-Command`, which the execution
policy does not govern. Scripts that a command itself calls run under the same
process scope; the shell tool's approval and sandbox settings, not the
execution policy, decide what may run.

To let the machine or user policy apply instead, set
`CODEWHALE_POWERSHELL_EXECUTION_POLICY=inherit` before starting Codewhale: the
shell tool then omits `-ExecutionPolicy` entirely, so a `Restricted` or
`AllSigned` policy refuses multiline commands that need the temporary `.ps1`
script. Unset, `bypass`, or any other value keeps the default `Bypass`.

## Consolidated runtime commands

The current `codewhale` binary runs the TUI in-process. Release installers copy
the same bytes to the optional `codew` short command; no sibling
`codewhale-tui` executable is required. `DEEPSEEK_TUI_BIN` remains a legacy
replay/migration setting, not a current install requirement.
