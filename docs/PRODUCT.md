# Product

<!-- impeccable:product-schema 1 -->

## Platform

web (the public site and docs in `web/`), documenting a terminal application
(the Rust TUI in `crates/tui`). Paths below are relative to the repository
root.

## Users

Developers who run a coding agent in their own terminal against their own
repositories: solo maintainers, small teams, and open-source contributors. They
arrive at the site to decide whether to install, to install, and then to look up
how a command, mode, or concept works. Many already use a competing agent and
compare on model choice, cost, and control.

## Product Purpose

Codewhale is an open-source (MIT) coding agent and terminal UI written in Rust
(Ratatui + Tokio; sandboxed tools via Bubblewrap/Seatbelt). Given a model and a
task it reads the repository, edits files, runs the checks, and stops when the
job is done or it needs a human. The site exists to (1) get a developer from
"what is this" to a working install in one screen, and (2) be the canonical,
current documentation for the shipped release. Success is an install that works
and a docs answer found without leaving the page.

## Positioning

Bring your own model. Codewhale is provider-neutral: any hosted, gateway, or
local model, and a different model per role. The user's model inventory is the
**Fleet** (`codewhale fleet`, `/fleet`; `pod` remains a compatibility alias).
Modes are Plan, Work, Operate; permission levels are Ask, Auto-Review, Full
Access. The agent runs on the user's machine, in the user's terminal — there is
no hosted runtime to sell.

## Operating Context

- Install: official GitHub Releases first. New macOS/Linux installs use
  `curl -fsSL https://codewhale.net/install.sh | sh`; Windows uses the matching
  GitHub installer/archive. Existing direct installs use `codewhale update`.
  npm and Cargo are secondary packaging routes; migration and PATH handling
  follow `docs/INSTALL.md`. `latest` selects a published release, not the source
  candidate. Facts (version, provider count, tool count, license) are
  derived from the repository by `npm run prebuild` into
  `web/lib/facts.generated.ts` and must never be hand-edited.
- Docs pages mirror `docs/*.md` in the repository; `npm run check:docs`
  verifies the mapping. Public vocabulary lives in
  `web/lib/content/vocabulary.ts` and `docs/public-surface-facts.json`.
- Localised through shared dictionaries in `web/lib/i18n/dictionaries/` with
  locale-key parity enforced; no page-local copy forks.
- The terminal puts the conversation above the composer, posture and metrics.
  Its workbar exposes Tasks, Fleet, Jobs, Files, Notes, Context, Git and Cost.
  Product previews come from the installed native TUI's actual PTY cells;
  the Ratatui explorer separately demonstrates reusable components with example data.

## Capabilities and Constraints

- Public name is **Codewhale** (lowercase w). `CodeWhale` survives only in
  compatibility identifiers (GitHub org/repo, package scopes).
- Provider and model names are first-class and neutral; never rank providers
  in copy.
- `web/lib/media-manifest.ts` records the exact captured native build and
  shared README image. Home, composer, workbar, provider selection and help
  are captured in an isolated offline session, with their original text and
  colors. They appear on the homepage, product page and getting-started guide.
  Session video remains `pending`; static UI captures do not claim a completed
  provider workflow. Build captions distinguish development builds from releases.
- `/context-window` does not exist on the current base; do not document it.
- Subagent role identifiers are those the code accepts (`general`, `explore`,
  `planner`, `reviewer`, `implement`, `test`, `advisor`, `custom`); the older
  spellings `worker`, `scout`, `builder`, `verifier`, `consultant`, and `oracle`
  are accepted as compatibility aliases only. Do not invent public role names.

## Brand Commitments

- Voice: quiet, dense, factual. Terminal vocabulary, no marketing superlatives,
  no fabricated transcripts or reasoning traces.
- "It doesn't need to look special — it needs to look like Codewhale."
- Assets: the canonical vector family lives in the CWC repo at
  `codewhale-apps/packages/brand/svg/` (mark, mark-gradient, mark-mono,
  mark-reversed, wordmark, wordmark-inverted); `brand/` and
  `web/public/brand/` carry byte-identical copies — sync from there, never
  re-trace. The founder's brand sheet `brand/codewhalemarkfinal.png` remains
  the source `scripts/brand/braille-mark.py` derives TUI launch art from. The
  earlier local trace and `scripts/brand/trace-brand.py` were retired
  2026-09-15 in favor of the canonical family. Web copies live in
  `web/public/brand/`.
- Palette, type, shell direction, and the anti-slop rules are recorded in
  `docs/design/DESIGN.md`; the colour tokens are owned by `crates/palette/src/rgb.rs`
  and exported to `web/app/tokens.css`.

## Evidence on Hand

- Real: GitHub stars (live), release version and changelog (generated),
  provider/tool counts (generated), the v0.9.12 development-build screenshot.
- Absent, do not fabricate: testimonials, customer logos, benchmarks,
  pricing, session video, or media of a published 0.9.12 release.

## Product Principles

1. One owner per fact: every number and command on the site is derived from
   the repository, never typed twice.
2. Content first: no permanent side chrome on the landing page; the docs page
   is a reading surface, not a portal.
3. Show only what exists: pending media stays marked pending; commands are
   documented only once they are on the base branch.
4. Provider-neutral, model-neutral, always.
5. Accessibility is not negotiable: AA contrast, ≥12px functional text, real
   heading outline, keyboard-reachable everything.

## Accessibility & Inclusion

WCAG 2.2 AA for text and controls. The audience includes screen-reader and
keyboard-only developers; the site is also read at 390px on phones.
