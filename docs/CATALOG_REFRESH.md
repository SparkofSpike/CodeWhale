# Catalog refresh

How Codewhale keeps model metadata current — what already auto-updates, what
is hand-maintained, and what a scheduled catalog job should (and should not) do.

## Short answer

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Do users need a special model just to refresh models? | **No.** |
| Does Codewhale auto-update the public model catalog? | **Yes, at runtime**, from [Models.dev](https://models.dev/catalog.json), ~24 h TTL. |
| Is the offline bundled seed auto-committed in CI? | **No, but it is generated.** A maintainer runs `seed lock` and `seed render` and opens a PR; CI fails a hand edit (`seed render --check`). |
| Should an LLM rewrite catalog JSON? | **No.** Ingest is deterministic public JSON. An LLM can *review* a PR, not own the source of truth. |

## Layers (lowest → highest priority)

The shared catalog compiler applies these layers from lowest to highest:

```
0 bundled Models.dev
10 live Models.dev
12 Codewhale corrections (applied to layers 0 and 10 as they load)
15 verified cloud facts (optional, off by default)
20 exact provider-owned live roster
25 Codewhale account roster
30 config.toml
40 user overrides
policy DENY (final)
```

Codewhale corrections live in `crates/config/assets/catalog_corrections.json`.
They are field patches in the cloud-facts `ModelFact` shape, applied by the same
patch code to every Models.dev row, offline seed and live refresh alike, so a
correction holds on every install. Use one when an upstream fact is true but
misleading for a Codewhale route: `pricing_withheld` (a reason) clears the price
so the route reports it as unknown, for tiered rates, plan quota and billing
surfaces the catalog cannot tell apart; `max_output` and the other fields patch
limits. Every entry carries its reason. Corrections only fix rows that exist,
never add or hide one, and signed cloud facts can still override them. A
corrected row keeps its own source; a price a correction owns reports
`CatalogSource::CodewhaleBundled` as its price source. Do not hand-edit the offline seed
to hold a value back: a live refresh replaces the seed row, so the hold would
work only offline.

Cloud facts use the existing compiler and provider lake, as described in
[`CLOUD_FACTS.md`](./CLOUD_FACTS.md). Capability provenance and price provenance
are separate: a capability patch cannot relabel inherited prices. Cloud price
patches replace the entire price block; unspecified token classes stay unknown.

Route resolution also binds provider kind, configured identity and endpoint.
A fresh provider-owned roster is authoritative for its exact scope. Explicit
model selections remain explicit. Codex account observations/native cache and
Ollama endpoint tags keep their dedicated availability rules; a public catalog
row does not prove that an account can call that model. The installed Codex
`account/read` and `model/list` path is documented in
[`PROVIDERS.md`](./PROVIDERS.md).

Legacy completion lists remain a last fallback where no applicable catalog
exists. Bundled seeds and static transport/billing rules remain release-owned;
refreshing catalog metadata does not introduce a new wire dialect or change
credential/billing ownership.

Key code:

| Piece | Path | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Live fetch + cache | `crates/tui/src/models_dev_live.rs` | Background refresh, TTL, atomic write, freshness status |
| Schema / parse | `crates/config/src/models_dev.rs` | Network-free Models.dev JSON shape |
| Compile + provenance | `crates/config/src/catalog.rs` | Ordered sources, independent price provenance, policy deny, id normalization |
| Provider lake merge | `crates/tui/src/provider_lake.rs` | Shared catalog projection with exact route-scoped provider authority |
| Offline seed asset | `crates/config/assets/models_dev.bundled.json` | Compact offline fallback only (`_meta.role` says so) |
| Codewhale corrections | `crates/config/assets/catalog_corrections.json` | Field patches applied to every Models.dev row (`crates/config/src/catalog/corrections.rs`) |
| Validation script | `scripts/catalog_models_dev.py` | Secret-free fetch/validate dry-run (#4117) |
| Script tests | `scripts/catalog_models_dev_test.py` | Offline shape/scrub checks |

## What already auto-updates (runtime)

When the TUI/runtime starts (and is not disabled):

1. Seed pickers from the **on-disk cache** if present (even if stale).
2. If the cache is missing or older than **24 hours**, **background-fetch**
   Models.dev (15 s timeout, explicit Codewhale user-agent, **no credentials**).
3. On success: atomic write to
   `~/.codewhale/catalog/models-dev-catalog.json` and publish rows into
   ProviderLake as `CatalogSource::ModelsDevLive` — layer 10, carrying no
   endpoint fingerprint. Models.dev is a public catalog describing a model, so
   a refreshed row is treated exactly like the layer-0 seed it supersedes and
   stays correctable by layer 15. `CatalogSource::Live` is reserved for a
   provider's own credential-scoped `/models` answer at layer 20.
4. On failure: keep prior cache or fall back to the **bundled** seed. Model
   selection never hard-fails because Models.dev is down.

### Manual force refresh

In the TUI:

```text
/model refresh
```

That dispatches `AppAction::RefreshModelsDevCatalog` (async; does not block
the composer). When admitted cloud-facts settings are enabled, it also requests
a cloud refresh; hard-disable and trust-key checks still apply. Implementation lives under
`crates/tui/src/commands/groups/core/core.rs` and
`crates/tui/src/models_dev_live.rs`.

### Env knobs (tests / dogfood / offline)

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `CODEWHALE_MODELS_DEV_URL` | Override base URL or full `*.json` catalog URL |
| `CODEWHALE_MODELS_DEV_PATH` | Load catalog from a local file; skip network |
| `CODEWHALE_DISABLE_MODELS_DEV_FETCH` | Truthy → never hit the network (`1` / `true` / `yes` / `on`) |

Defaults:

- Catalog URL: `https://models.dev/catalog.json`
- TTL: `24 * 60 * 60` seconds (`DEFAULT_MODELS_DEV_TTL_SECS`)
- Cache file name: `models-dev-catalog.json` under the Codewhale `catalog`
  state dir

Freshness values exposed for UI / status chips: `bundled` | `live` | `stale` |
`failed`.

## What does **not** auto-update (repo / release)

These stay hand-maintained or release-lane work until a scheduled PR lands:

| Surface | Why it drifts |
|---|---|
| `models_dev.bundled.json` | Offline seed, generated from a reviewed spec and a pinned lock (see below); refreshed by PR, not at runtime |
| `provider_descriptors.json` default model IDs | Product choice, not pure catalog dump; constant projections are generated |
| `catalog_corrections.json` `reviewed` | Intrinsic/selector/transport compatibility facts with exact source receipts; generated into the same seed |
| Rust pricing policy | Vendor billing windows, CNY conversion, withheld/tiered behavior; pure reference observations live in the reviewed supplement |
| New `ProviderKind` / wire dialect | Needs code, not only JSON |

Runtime live refresh **does not** rewrite those files. Users on a recent
install with network still see new Models.dev rows; fresh clones offline, CI
hermetic runs, and first-boot without cache still depend on the seed.

---

## Maintainer tooling (no LLM)

### Validate / dry-run fetch

```bash
# Fetch Models.dev + print counts (never writes disk)
python3 scripts/catalog_models_dev.py refresh

# Validate the committed offline seed still parses as Models.dev-shaped JSON
python3 scripts/catalog_models_dev.py snapshot --check \
  crates/config/assets/models_dev.bundled.json

# OpenRouter public /models listing (no API key), dry-run only
python3 scripts/catalog_models_dev.py refresh --provider openrouter \
  --sort newest --limit 100
```

Design constraints of the script (intentional):

- Public endpoints only — no `Authorization` headers, no API keys.
- Credential-shaped keys are scrubbed if present in remote JSON.
- `refresh` and `snapshot` never write (`--write` / `--write-cache` fail
  closed). The one write path is `seed lock`, which pins only the rows the
  spec references, projected onto allowlisted fields.

### Regenerating the offline seed (#6396)

`crates/config/assets/models_dev.bundled.json` is generated. Never edit it by
hand: CI runs `seed render --check` and fails on any difference.

| File | Holds | Edited by |
|---|---|---|
| `scripts/catalog/models_dev_seed.toml` | Which upstream rows to carry, their Codewhale provider id, wire id, default, canonical join, and the few curated rows upstream does not list | Hand, reviewed |
| `scripts/catalog/models_dev_seed.lock.json` | The referenced upstream rows, allowlisted, plus the source URL, fetch time and sha256 | `seed lock` only |
| `crates/config/assets/catalog_corrections.json` | Deliberate holds: withheld prices, clamped limits, reasoning controls | Hand, reviewed; applies online too |
| `crates/config/assets/catalog_corrections.json` `reviewed` | Source-preserved intrinsic facts, scoped aliases, completion references, public labels/source-support dates, pure route facts and reference prices | Hand, reviewed; source receipts retained |
| `crates/config/assets/models_dev.bundled.json` | The rendered seed including the reviewed supplement | `seed render` only |

The spec selects and maps; it cannot state a value that disagrees with
upstream (unknown keys are refused). If an upstream value is wrong for a
Codewhale route, add a correction instead. Corrections apply to both the seed
and live rows; a hold made only by hand-editing the seed would vanish on the
first live refresh.

1. `python3 scripts/catalog_models_dev.py seed lock --dry-run` prints the
   review report: field changes per row, corrections that upstream now
   agrees with (delete them), and upstream models not carried. It fails when
   a referenced row disappeared upstream, or a curated row now exists
   upstream (switch it to a derived row).
2. Edit the spec or the corrections as the report requires.
3. `python3 scripts/catalog_models_dev.py seed lock` writes the lock.
4. `python3 scripts/catalog_models_dev.py seed render` writes the seed.
5. Check that default wire IDs still match `DEFAULT_*_MODEL`, run the
   catalog tests, and open a PR with the report in its body.

Optional: use a cheap model to summarize “new / removed / default-risk” in
the PR body — never as the author of the JSON.

## Recommended scheduled job (not shipped yet)

Goal: keep the **in-repo offline seed** from rotting, without giving CI write
power over secrets or unsupervised LLM rewrites.

```text
cron (daily or weekly)
  → fetch Models.dev (public, no keys)
  → validate shape + scrub
  → compare against crates/config/assets/models_dev.bundled.json
     (and optionally report new ids vs provider defaults)
  → if material change: open PR
       title: chore(catalog): refresh Models.dev offline seed
  → optional: include an agent-written, human-readable diff summary in the PR body
```

Such a job would run `seed lock` and `seed render` and open the PR. A PR
opened with the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not trigger CI, so it needs a bot
token or GitHub App, which a maintainer has to provision.

### In scope for automation

- Deterministic catalog ingest from Models.dev
- Secret-free PR diffs
- Drift reports (new model ids, missing defaults, pricing presence)

### Out of scope for automation

- Claude Pro/Max / subscription OAuth “model discovery” (not a supported
  third-party path; Anthropic expects API keys for third-party tools)
- LLM-authored edits to `models.rs` / `provider.rs` without review
- Force-pushing `main` or silent asset rewrites on the default branch
- Treating Models.dev as the only truth for OAuth-scoped routes (Codex
  roster remains special-cased)

### Suggested workflow home

`CodeWhale/.github/workflows/catalog-refresh.yml` (or similar), reusing
`scripts/catalog_models_dev.py` after a deliberate **write-safe** extension
that only runs in CI with a bot token for PR creation — still not on
`workflow_dispatch` without review if writes land in-repo.

Nightly today (`/.github/workflows/nightly.yml`) builds release artifacts
only; it does **not** refresh catalogs.

## Do we need a “model dedicated to updating models”?

**No for the core loop.**

| Job | Right tool |
|---|---|
| Keep known models/windows/prices from Models.dev fresh for users | Runtime live fetch (already shipped) |
| Keep offline seed + release assets current in git | Scheduled CI → PR (to build) |
| Decide whether to bump a product default model | Human (or agent *review* on the PR) |
| Wire a brand-new provider kind / dialect | Human PR + tests |

An LLM is optional **review** of a catalog PR. It is a poor **source of
truth** for catalog JSON.

---

## Auth note (Claude / Anthropic)

Anthropic model **catalog** refresh does not require Claude Pro/Max OAuth.
Models.dev is public. Codewhale’s Anthropic route remains **API-key-based**
for inference (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`). Do not couple catalog automation to
subscription OAuth or Claude Code identity headers.

## Quick operator checklist

- [ ] Running install: confirm network not blocked; optional
      `/model refresh` after a big vendor launch.
- [ ] Offline / CI hermetic: set `CODEWHALE_DISABLE_MODELS_DEV_FETCH=1` or
      point `CODEWHALE_MODELS_DEV_PATH` at a fixture.
- [ ] Before release: `seed lock --dry-run` to see how far the offline seed
      has drifted from Models.dev; re-lock by PR if it matters. Skim
      `PROVIDERS.md` for known drift.
- [ ] After Models.dev adds a major family you ship by default: consider
      seed PR + default-model decision separately.
- [ ] Never paste API keys into catalog assets or the automation script env
      for Models.dev refresh.

### Retired unscoped metadata reader

The former models crate cache reader and its separate bundled asset, and the
TUI-only model registry, are retired. Existing installed legacy cache files are
preserved and are never imported as provider or public-label authority.
`config::catalog` owns the immutable compiled intrinsic projection; Engine's
existing provider lake and scoped catalog cache still own live/account/config
facts. Identical wire names at different endpoints do not create a canonical
join, a public label, or an unscoped price. The bundled freshness clock uses the
actual seed lock fetch timestamp and rechecks the current clock on each query.

Compatibility completion lists reference the provider descriptor defaults and
catalog groups rather than repeating their values. Kimi's generation default
remains distinct from direct/membership route limits. Unknown capabilities and
name-suffix budgets remain explicitly unverified. Website model dates describe
source support, with the prior proven dates retained in the same reviewed owner;
they do not assert a provider release date or current API availability.
