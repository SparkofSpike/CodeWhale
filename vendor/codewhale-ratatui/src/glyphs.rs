//! Codewhale's terminal glyph charter.
//!
//! Renderers use semantic names from this module instead of choosing visual
//! punctuation ad hoc. The solid current marker (`●`) is the recurring
//! Codewhale anchor: it marks the active speaker or current human choice.
//! ASCII-safe terminals receive the semantic fallback from the same owner.
//!
//! Extracted from the Codewhale engine's `crates/tui/src/tui/glyphs.rs`
//! (`Hmbown/CodeWhale` `58b1dd3dd`, last changed in `d7712814e`). One meaning
//! per glyph: `●` current or running, `✓` done, `✕` failed, `◆` needs you,
//! `○` ready, `■` stopped, `▸` selection, `?` unknown.
